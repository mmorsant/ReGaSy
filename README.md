# **mmorsant Console Game System**

### **What?**
I present to you a basic game engine that brings simple functions to the programmer, enabling to create fancy histories on the Windows cmd console.
Its based on Rogue(1980) and started from scratch; where I want to put some things learned and make fun game system that posibilities everything.

### **Why?**
Because its the best thing to run our code and see it working and, most importantly, I love videogames.

### **Who?**
I'm from Argentina and I study medicine, while in the spaces between books and practices I search a lot about programming in C++.

### **Objectives** (ready's are labeled):
- [x] World grid default and user's set up (size, ascii tiles).
- [ ] Player spawn, movement, collision and life/damage system automation.
- [ ] Enemy template creation (ascii tile, movement, amount of damage).
- [ ] Puzzle object template creation (action, ascii tile).
- [ ] Room template creation (walls, floor, enemies).
- [ ] Random room generation (based on room templates) inside the world size connected by bridges.
- [ ] Statistics draw and setup.

### **Needs**
This program is set to run on every IDE (its write in VS with standard 17++) without any add, it is writed whith standard C++ code.
Just setup the "include directories" to the folder *&(ProjectDir)\include* (create one inside the project) and "library directories" to the folder *&(ProjectDir)\lib* (create another inside the project) and copy the .header into the include folder and the .cpp in the lib folder. #include <mmorGS.h> in your own main.cpp and import the mmorGS.cpp file to the project. Write the functions in order and create your own game history!!, and most importantly, have fun and be nice.

### **LICENSE**
Everything in this project is open and free to use, just please leave a comment to know if it works or some issues come to light.
