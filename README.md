# **mmorsant Console Game System**

### **What?**
I present to you a basic game engine that brings simple call functions to the programmer, enabling to create fancy histories on the Windows cmd console.
Its based on Rogue(1980) and started from scratch where I want to put some things learned and make fun game system that posibilities everything.

### **Why?**
Because its the best thing to run our code and see it working and, most importantly, I love videogames.

### **Who?**
I'm from Argentina and I study medicine, while in the spaces between books and practices I search a lot about programming in C++.

### **Objectives** (ready's are labeled):
#### Older project
- [x] ~~Movement and World Generation~~.
- [x] ~~Walls generation and collision~~.
- [x] ~~Enemies spawn and basic attacks~~.
- [ ] Spawn rooms based on rules (random generation).
- [ ] Puzzles.

#### New project
- [ ] World grid default and user's set up (size, ascii tiles).
- [ ] Player spawn, movement, collision and life/damage system automation.
- [ ] Enemy template creation (ascii tile, movement, amount of damage).
- [ ] Puzzle object template creation (action, ascii tile).
- [ ] Room template creation (walls, floor, enemies).
- [ ] Random room generation (based on room templates) inside the world size connected by bridges.
- [ ] Statistics draw and setup.

### **Needs**
This program is set to run without any add, it is writed whith standard C++ code.

### **LICENSE**
