## cmdGame-Roguelike

**What?**
cmdGame-Roguelike is a project based on Rogue(1980) that I start from scratch where I want to put the things I learn and make some fun game system that posibilities everything.

**Why?**
Because its the best thing to run our code and see it works and, most importantly, I love videogames.

**Who?**
I'm from Argentina and I study medicine, while in the spaces between books and practices I search a lot about programming in C++.

Objectives (ready's are labeled):
- ~~Movement and world generation~~.
- Walls generation.
- Enemies spawn and basic attacks.
- Spawn rooms with rules.
- Puzzles.
