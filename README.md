## cmdGame-Roguelike

**What?**
cmdGame-Roguelike is a project based on Rogue(1980) that I start from scratch where I want to put the things I learn and make some fun game system that posibilities everything.

**Why?**
Because its the best thing to run our code and see it works and, most importantly, I love videogames.
